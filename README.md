## Description
This is an Express-based note taking program that allows a user to generate lists of notes. The user can create new notes, review old notes, and delete unneeded notes.

## Usage

Click "Get Started," which will bring you to a main page. This page has a section for composing new notes on the right side, and a list of old notes on the left side.

To generate a new note, enter your note title into the "New Title" field and your note text into the "New Text" field. Upon doing so, a "Save Note" and "Clear Form" button will appear in the upper right corner.

Click "Save Note" to save this to your list of notes on the left hand side. Click "Clear Form" to delete the text you input.

## Credits
This program was created by Jacob McAuliffe for the UC Berkeley eDX Coding Boot Camp.

## Tests
In the future, I would like to incorporate updates to both the composition of the notes as well as the site functionality. For note composition, adding features such as the ability to change text font, add pictures, or auto-date notes could make for practical next steps. In terms of site functionality, features such as ways of organizing the notes by date or subject, or to be able to download notes in different file types, could make this program even more useful.
